# unique-death-speedruns
All the features of [death speedrun](https://github.com/random1785/death-speedrun), but with a twist: no player can get the same death message twice!

## Features:
/trigger unique to see which death messages are still possible<br>
/trigger repeat to see which death messages have already been done<br>
description of death message available if players hover over it in chat<br>
2500 tick limit in case it takes way too long --> 4000 tick score if no death is done<br>
show death messages off, players respawn in lobby (impossible to see what other players did)

## Todo list:
none for now!
